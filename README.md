### Chitter Challenge in Python
- A very lightweight clone of a popular social media site using Python and flask 
- I decided to do this based off of having to do the same challenge using ruby and sinatra during the Makers course. 

## Running Chitter 
- clone this repository
- set up a virtual environment (you may need to install virtualenv)
```
$ python -m virtualenv venv
```
- activate the virtual environment
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
- install packages from requirements.txt
```
$ pip install
```
- create the database dependencies from file
- run the app
```
$ flask run
```

## Running tests
```
$ python -m unittest
```
